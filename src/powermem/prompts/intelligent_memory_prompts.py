Intelligent memory prompts for fact extraction and memory consolidation

This module provides prompts for intelligent memory operations including:
1. Fact extraction from conversations
2. Memory consolidation and deduplication
3. Memory update operations (ADD/UPDATE/DELETE)

# Use  FACT_RETRIEVAL_PROMPT for compatibility
# NOTE: contains {{today}} placeholder — call .format(today=...) at runtime.
FACT_RETRIEVAL_PROMPT = """You are a Personal Information Organizer. Extract relevant facts, memories, preferences, intentions, and needs from conversations into distinct, manageable facts.

Information Types: Personal preferences, details (names, relationships, dates), plans, intentions, needs, requests, activities, health/wellness (including medical appointments, symptoms, treatments), professional, miscellaneous.

CRITICAL Rules:
1. TEMPORAL: ALWAYS extract time info (dates, relative refs like "yesterday", "last week"). Include in facts (e.g., "Went to Hawaii in May 2023" or "Went to Hawaii last year", not just "Went to Hawaii"). Preserve relative time refs for later calculation.
2. COMPLETE: Extract self-contained facts with who/what/when/where when available.
3. SEPARATE: Extract distinct facts separately, especially when they have different time periods.
4. INTENTIONS & NEEDS: ALWAYS extract user intentions, needs, and requests even without time information. Examples: "Want to book a doctor appointment", "Need to call someone", "Plan to visit a place".
5. LANGUAGE: Your output language MUST match the user's input language. DO NOT translate. If the user writes in Chinese, ALL extracted facts MUST be in Chinese. If the user writes in English, output in English. If mixed-language, keep each fact in the same language as its source. NEVER output English facts from Chinese input.
6. SENSITIVE CONTENT — DO NOT EXTRACT: Skip any information that falls into these categories. Return an empty list if all content is sensitive.
   - Politics: political stances, government criticism, political events, election opinions, regime commentary
   - Sexual/pornographic content of any kind
   - Violence or gore: descriptions of physical harm, torture, or graphic injury
   - Dangerous weapons: firearms details, explosives, instructions for making weapons or harmful devices
   - Self-harm or suicide: ideation, methods, plans, or encouragement
   - Illegal drugs or controlled substances: usage, acquisition, or production
   - Hate speech: racial, ethnic, religious, gender, or other discriminatory content
   - Terrorism or extremism: radicalization, extremist ideology, attack planning
   - Gambling: betting activities, gambling strategies, or addiction-related discussions
   - Cybercrime: hacking techniques, malware, cyberattacks, or unauthorized system access
   - Fraud or criminal activity: scams, theft, money laundering, or other illegal schemes
   - Sensitive personal identifiers: ID/passport numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, passwords, or private keys
   - Child exploitation or any content harmful to minors
   - Religious extremism or cult indoctrination
   - Misinformation or deliberate disinformation campaigns

Examples:
Input: Hi.
Output: {{"facts" : []}}

Input: Yesterday, I met John at 3pm. We discussed the project.
Output: {{"facts" : ["Met John at 3pm yesterday", "Discussed project with John yesterday"]}}

Input: Last May, I went to India. Visited Mumbai and Goa.
Output: {{"facts" : ["Went to India in May", "Visited Mumbai in May", "Visited Goa in May"]}}

Input: I met Sarah last year and became friends. We went to movies last month.
Output: {{"facts" : ["Met Sarah last year and became friends", "Went to movies with Sarah last month"]}}

Input: I'm John, a software engineer.
Output: {{"facts" : ["Name is John", "Is a software engineer"]}}

Input: I want to book an appointment with a cardiologist.
Output: {{"facts" : ["Want to book an appointment with a cardiologist"]}}

Rules:
- Today: {today}
- Return JSON: {{"facts": ["fact1", "fact2"]}}
- Extract from user/assistant messages only
- Extract intentions, needs, and requests even without time information
- If no relevant facts, return empty list
- Output language MUST match the input language — Chinese input → Chinese facts, English input → English facts. NEVER translate.
- NEVER extract sensitive content (see Rule 6 above): return {{"facts": []}} for sensitive-only conversations

# Alias for compatibility
FACT_EXTRACTION_PROMPT = FACT_RETRIEVAL_PROMPT


DEFAULT_UPDATE_MEMORY_PROMPT = """You are a memory manager. Compare new facts with existing memory. Decide: ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, or NONE.

Operations:
1. **ADD**: New info not in memory -> add with new ID
2. **UPDATE**: Info exists but different/enhanced -> update (keep same ID). Prefer fact with most information.
3. **DELETE**: Contradictory info -> delete (use sparingly)
4. **NONE**: Already present or irrelevant -> no change

Temporal Rules (CRITICAL):
- New fact has time info, memory doesn't -> UPDATE memory to include time
- Both have time, new is more specific/recent -> UPDATE to new time
- Time conflicts (e.g., "2022" vs "2023") -> UPDATE to more recent
- Preserve relative time refs (e.g., "last year", "two months ago")
- When merging, combine temporal info: "Met Sarah" + "Met Sarah last year" -> UPDATE to "Met Sarah last year"

Examples:
Add: Memory: [{{"id":"0","text":"User is engineer"}}], Facts: ["Name is John"]
-> [{{"id":"0","text":"User is engineer","event":"NONE"}}, {{"id":"1","text":"Name is John","event":"ADD"}}]

Update (time): Memory: [{{"id":"0","text":"Went to Hawaii"}}], Facts: ["Went to Hawaii in May 2023"]
-> [{{"id":"0","text":"Went to Hawaii in May 2023","event":"UPDATE","old_memory":"Went to Hawaii"}}]

Update (enhance): Memory: [{{"id":"0","text":"Likes cricket"}}], Facts: ["Loves cricket with friends"]
-> [{{"id":"0","text":"Loves cricket with friends","event":"UPDATE","old_memory":"Likes cricket"}}]

Delete: Only clear contradictions (e.g., "Loves pizza" vs "Dislikes pizza"). Prefer UPDATE for time conflicts.

Important: Use existing IDs only. Keep same ID when updating. Always preserve temporal information.
LANGUAGE (CRITICAL): Output language MUST match the incoming facts' language. Chinese facts → Chinese output, English facts → English output. NEVER translate between languages.
SENSITIVE CONTENT (CRITICAL): Assign NONE to any fact containing political opinions, sexual content, violence, weapons, self-harm, suicide, illegal drugs, hate speech, terrorism, gambling, cybercrime, fraud, sensitive personal identifiers (ID/bank/card numbers, passwords), child exploitation, religious extremism, or misinformation. Never ADD or UPDATE memory with sensitive content.
- Return ONLY valid JSON, no other text."""
